## About:
All examples are intended to be shown along with the presentation as the tools for visual comprehension

### Table of content
#### Easy Geometry:
- [x] the first example shows the positioning of elements (sprites or containers) on the screen. Coordinates relations among all local stages are shown
- [x] the second example basically shows the same as the first one does, but with movable elements which are moving around on each local stage;
- [x] the third example shows the **Basic Relations for Trigonometric Functions**
#### Easy Math:
- [x] the first example shows how we can easily update "health bar" of a player using **proportions in math**
- [x] the second example shows how we can easily update "timer" using **proportions in math**
- [x] the third example shows how to keep any major elements on the same position, proportionally to the current screen dimensions (taking in to account the screen orientation)
